# Minimal-FVWM
Minimal Fvwm configuration for Debian Buster system. With only 900 pkg you can hace a fully working system without bloating stuff. 

FVWM config is based on Knuth config, but this was adapted for modern fvwm version (2.6.8) and cleared warnings in .xsession log.

Dependencies:

You can install whatever you want, but i use these cute apps:

`Transmission-gtk`-for torrents, `mpv`-for video, `mpg123` and `moc`-for audio. For web browsing i use `Firefox-esr` and `w3m`, for viewing pictures i use `sxiv`, for irc chat-`irssi`. For working with files i use simple file managers: `fff` (it is in directory `~/.bin`) and `mc`. Also i use cutty terminal apps:`screenfetch-dev`, `neofetch`, `pfetch`and `pfe`.

For monitoring system resources, i use `conky` (config in this repo), `top` and `gotop`. 

My main terminal is good and fast `xterm`. Colors for this terminal is in `.Xresource` file.

My version control system os `git`.

In my system i do not use pulseaudio. Only `alsa` with `alsamixer`.

P.S.

Do not forget add directory `~/.local/bin` to your path! This is not necessary, but much comfortable to work!
